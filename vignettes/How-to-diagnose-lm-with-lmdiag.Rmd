```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

```{r setup}
library(lmdiag)
```

Let's fit a simple lm model first.

```{r}
lm_life_gdp <- lm(lifeExp ~ gdpPercap, data = gapminder::gapminder)
```

Then we use `lm_diag` to test the residuals' normality and equal variances assumptions:

```{r}
lm_diag(lm_life_gdp)
```
The result "fail" indicates at least one of the assumptions failed.   

We can check which assumption failed by showing the p-values of both test:

```{r}
lm_diag(lm_life_gdp, output.p = TRUE)
```

In this case, both tests rejected the null hypothesis.

Furthermore, we can change the alpha level of the tests (this works only for text output):

```{r}
lm_diag(lm_life_gdp, alpha = 0.1)
```
